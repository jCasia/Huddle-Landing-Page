## Hello Again ðŸ‘‹

For this challenge I had to create a landing page for Huddle, I thoroughly enjoyed coding this project and it had definitely tested my knowledge in CSS Grid, Flexbox and as well as making the landing page responsive to view the optimal layout for the page depending on the users device's screen size. I also included a few basic interactive element on the page!
